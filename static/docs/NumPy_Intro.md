## Array Computing using NumPy

NumPy offers a comprehensive set of mathematical operations that are highly optimized for speed and efficiency. This is why it's a fundamental library for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing. Each operation leverages vectorization and low-level optimizations to perform tasks faster than traditional looping constructs in Python.

Common mathematical operations supported by NumPy, including summaries, use case scenarios, efficiency insights, and Python code snippets.

   - **Summary**: Element-wise addition of two arrays.
   - **Use Case**: Useful in aggregating data across multiple arrays, such as adding pixel values in image processing.
   - **Efficiency**: Highly efficient due to vectorization, making it significantly faster than manual looping.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     import numpy as np
     a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
     b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
     result = a + b  # Output: [5, 7, 9]
     ```

### 2. **Array Subtraction (`-`)**

   - **Summary**: Sorts the elements of an array in ascending order.
   - **Use Case**: Common in algorithms that need sorted data (e.g., median finding).

Prompt Inputs:
In the NumPy overview you say "support for multi-dimensional arrays and a large collection of mathematical operations"... can you iterate a list/collection of each of these kinds of math operations. For each supported operation in the list, can you provide a short summary (summary text), a use case scenario, and an estimate of efficiency (if known/common), and also a short snipped of Python (if possible)?
