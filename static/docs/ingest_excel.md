P1: In Excel, I can create the scatter plot, but I would like to do so for a few countries. Once a chart is created, can I freeze it somehow, so the data is preserved, but if I adjust/filter the underlying table the chart is not updated? 

### Response 1: 
Yes, in Excel, you can preserve a chart with its current data, even if you adjust or filter the underlying table. There are two main ways to achieve this: **copying and pasting the chart as a static image** or **freezing the chart by referencing a snapshot of the data**. Here's how to do both:

### Method 1: Copy the Chart as an Image
If you don't need the chart to remain dynamic and just want to preserve it as a snapshot:

1. **Create the Chart** using your data.
2. Once the chart is as you want it, **right-click** on the chart.
3. Select **Copy**.
4. Click where you want the static version of the chart (e.g., in another sheet or section of your current sheet).
5. **Right-click** and choose **Paste as Picture** (under the paste options). This will paste the chart as a non-updating image.

   - This method "freezes" the chart in its current state as a picture, so it won’t change even if the data or filters are adjusted.

### Method 2: Create a Snapshot Data Range for the Chart
If you want the chart to remain dynamic but not update based on future changes or filtering in the original table:

1. **Create a Separate Range for the Chart**:
   - Copy the relevant data from the table that you want to visualize (for example, your filtered data for multiple countries).
   - Paste this data into another part of the spreadsheet or into another sheet.
   - Use **Paste Special** to paste values only (this will prevent links to the original data).
   
2. **Create the Chart from the Snapshot**:
   - Create your chart based on this static range, rather than the original dynamic table.
   
   Now, any changes to the original table (like filters or edits) will not affect the chart, since it's based on a fixed range of data that doesn't change.

### Bonus: Using a Pivot Chart (Partial Solution)
If you're working with multiple countries and want more control, you can also consider using a **Pivot Chart**, which allows you to visualize data in different ways while keeping control over filtering. You can set up a **Pivot Table** and **Pivot Chart** based on your data, then **disable pivot table refresh** for certain situations. However, this might not fully "freeze" the chart if the pivot table is adjusted.

---

### Conclusion:
- **If you need a completely static chart**, copying the chart and pasting it as an image is your best option.
- **If you want to preserve some flexibility**, using a snapshot range is a good choice. This way, you can prevent the chart from being updated by changes in the underlying data without completely losing the ability to adjust the chart later.



P2: Can you take the following pseudologic, and create a formula for use in Excel? =SUM(column E, on any row where column B in the same row ="United States of America")

### Response 2:
To create a formula in Excel that sums the values in **column E** where the corresponding **column B** value is `"United States of America"`, you can use the **`SUMIF`** function. The `SUMIF` function sums values based on a condition.

Here’s how to construct the formula:

```excel
=SUMIF(B:B, "United States of America", E:E)
```

### Explanation:
- `B:B`: This is the range where Excel will look for the condition (the country names in column B).
- `"United States of America"`: This is the condition; Excel will sum values where the country name is exactly "United States of America".
- `E:E`: This is the range of values to sum (the values in column E).

This formula will sum the values in **column E** only when the corresponding cell in **column B** is equal to `"United States of America"`.


P3: To express an AND conditional were two rows of data are checked, how would I adjust this formula? =SUMIF(B:B, "United States of America", and C:C, "Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)", E:E)

### Response 3: 
To use an **AND** condition in Excel, where you want to sum values based on multiple criteria (i.e., both **column B** equals `"United States of America"` and **column C** equals `"Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)"`), you would need to use the **`SUMIFS`** function.

Here's how to modify the formula:

```excel
=SUMIFS(E:E, B:B, "United States of America", C:C, "Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)")
```

### Explanation:
- `E:E`: This is the range to sum (the values in column E).
- `B:B, "United States of America"`: This is the first condition; Excel will only consider rows where the country in column B is `"United States of America"`.
- `C:C, "Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)"`: This is the second condition; Excel will also only consider rows where the value in column C is `"Emissions (thousand metric tons of carbon dioxide)"`.

The **`SUMIFS`** function works for multiple conditions (AND logic), summing only the values that meet **both** conditions.



P4: Given MS Excel, and the following data taken from the UN on C02 emissions, how can a chart be created which accurately represents the data, while considering that the timeline (years given) are not linear? """ United States of America	1975	CO2 Emissions thousand metric tons	4,409,861
United States of America	1985	CO2 Emissions thousand metric tons	4,572,448
To create a chart in Excel that accurately represents the **CO2 emissions** data while taking into account the **non-linear timeline** (irregular intervals in the years), follow these steps:

### Response 4

### 1. **Enter Data into Excel**
   Ensure the data is structured like this:

| Country               | Year | CO2 Emissions (thousand metric tons) |
|-----------------------|------|--------------------------------------|
| United States of America | 1975 | 4,409,861                          |
| United States of America | 1985 | 4,572,448                          |
| United States of America | 2005 | 5,781,166                          |
| United States of America | 2010 | 5,428,235                          |
| United States of America | 2015 | 5,004,513                          |
| United States of America | 2018 | 4,987,469                          |
| United States of America | 2019 | 4,821,298                          |
| United States of America | 2020 | 4,324,698                          |

### 2. **Select the Data**
   Highlight the two columns that contain the year and the emissions data (columns with **Year** and **CO2 Emissions**).

### 3. **Insert a Scatter Plot (XY Chart)**
   - Go to the **Insert** tab in the Excel ribbon.
   - In the **Charts** group, click on the **Scatter** chart type. Choose **Scatter with Straight Lines** or **Scatter with Smooth Lines** depending on the desired look.
   
   This chart type is useful when the X-axis (years) is non-linear, as it will plot each year at the correct intervals.

### 4. **Customize the Chart**
   After creating the scatter plot:
   - **Title the chart**: Click on the chart title and change it to something meaningful like "CO2 Emissions Over Time (United States)".
   - **Adjust axes labels**: 
     - Right-click on the X-axis (years) and add the label "Year."
     - Right-click on the Y-axis (emissions) and add the label "CO2 Emissions (thousand metric tons)."
   - **Adjust the gridlines and other formatting** to make the chart clear.

### 5. **Customize Data Markers (Optional)**
   If you want to emphasize specific years or data points:
   - Right-click on a data point and choose **Format Data Series**.
   - In the format menu, you can change the marker style, line color, or even add data labels to each point.

### 6. **Analyze the Chart**
   - Ensure the years appear at the correct intervals (e.g., there is a larger gap between 1985 and 2005 compared to 2015 and 2018).
   - The line should show the trend of emissions over time, illustrating any rises or falls in emissions.

### **Alternative: Line Chart (Adjusted for Non-Linear Axis)**
   If you prefer a **line chart** (instead of scatter), make sure the X-axis is correctly set to a **time axis** rather than a category axis:
   1. Right-click on the X-axis.
   2. Choose **Format Axis**.
   3. Change the Axis Type to **Date Axis** to ensure that Excel treats the years as time data, even though they are not evenly spaced.

This workflow should create an accurate representation of the data and make it easier for students to see how emissions have changed over time.
