To create a chart in Excel that accurately represents the CO2 emissions data while taking into account the non-linear timeline (irregular intervals in the years), follow these steps:
1. Enter Data into Excel

Ensure the data is structured like this:
Country	Year	CO2 Emissions (thousand metric tons)
United States of America	1975	4,409,861
United States of America	1985	4,572,448
United States of America	2005	5,781,166
United States of America	2010	5,428,235
United States of America	2015	5,004,513
United States of America	2018	4,987,469
United States of America	2019	4,821,298
United States of America	2020	4,324,698
2. Select the Data

Highlight the two columns that contain the year and the emissions data (columns with Year and CO2 Emissions).
3. Insert a Scatter Plot (XY Chart)

    Go to the Insert tab in the Excel ribbon.
    In the Charts group, click on the Scatter chart type. Choose Scatter with Straight Lines or Scatter with Smooth Lines depending on the desired look.

This chart type is useful when the X-axis (years) is non-linear, as it will plot each year at the correct intervals.
4. Customize the Chart

After creating the scatter plot:

    Title the chart: Click on the chart title and change it to something meaningful like "CO2 Emissions Over Time (United States)".
    Adjust axes labels:
        Right-click on the X-axis (years) and add the label "Year."
        Right-click on the Y-axis (emissions) and add the label "CO2 Emissions (thousand metric tons)."
    Adjust the gridlines and other formatting to make the chart clear.

5. Customize Data Markers (Optional)

If you want to emphasize specific years or data points:

    Right-click on a data point and choose Format Data Series.
    In the format menu, you can change the marker style, line color, or even add data labels to each point.

6. Analyze the Chart

    Ensure the years appear at the correct intervals (e.g., there is a larger gap between 1985 and 2005 compared to 2015 and 2018).
    The line should show the trend of emissions over time, illustrating any rises or falls in emissions.

Alternative: Line Chart (Adjusted for Non-Linear Axis)

If you prefer a line chart (instead of scatter), make sure the X-axis is correctly set to a time axis rather than a category axis:

    Right-click on the X-axis.
    Choose Format Axis.
    Change the Axis Type to Date Axis to ensure that Excel treats the years as time data, even though they are not evenly spaced.

This workflow should create an accurate representation of the data and make it easier for students to see how emissions have changed over time.
